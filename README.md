# netflix_project
This project is related to analysis of attacks to a recommendation system, using netflix dataset as movie recommendation system.

This project is implemented to detect abnormal ratings in the netflix movie recommendation system. Therefore, I have injected some fake ratings and then prediction models will be applied on that to detect the fake profiles.
